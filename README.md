# Low-Cost AI Voice Assistant with OpenAI, Deepgram & Twilio

Build your own AI voice assistant that can handle inbound calls using OpenAI's GPT for conversation, Deepgram for speech processing, and Twilio for telephony - all for around 1 cent per minute!

## Overview

This repository is Part 1 of a series demonstrating how to build production-ready AI voice assistants. In this first part, we focus on handling inbound calls and basic FAQ responses, achieving:

- ~1 second latency
- ~$0.01 per minute cost
- Natural conversation flow with interruption handling
- Scalable architecture for future expansion

Coming in Part 2 (stay tuned!):
- Function calling capabilities
- Outbound call handling
- Enhanced text-to-speech with 11.labs
- And more!

## System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

![CleanShot 2024-11-24 at 17 45 26](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/746793d6-8a0d-437e-8665-5ad82bffd4b5)

Key Components:
1. **Twilio**: Handles inbound calls and audio streaming
2. **Deepgram**: 
   - Speech-to-Text: Real-time transcription
   - Text-to-Speech: Response generation
3. **OpenAI GPT**: Natural language processing and response generation
4. **WebSocket Server**: Real-time audio streaming and service orchestration

### Code Architecture

![CleanShot 2024-11-24 at 17 45 09](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c712440e-11bc-4f5d-b586-add03df02b00)

The system is built with a modular architecture:
- `app.js`: Main server and WebSocket handling
- `services/`:
  - `gpt-service.js`: OpenAI integration and conversation management
  - `stream-service.js`: Audio streaming and buffer management
  - `transcription-service.js`: Speech-to-text processing
  - `tts-service.js`: Text-to-speech conversion

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- npm/yarn
- Accounts with:
  - Twilio
  - Deepgram
  - OpenAI

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Barty-Bart/ai-voice-assistant-openai-deepgram.git
cd ai-voice-assistant-openai-deepgram
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create `.env` file:
```env
SERVER=your-server-domain
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your-deepgram-api-key
VOICE_MODEL=your-preferred-voice-model
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

4. Configure Twilio:
- Set up a Twilio phone number
- Configure webhook to point to your `/incoming` endpoint
- Ensure your server has HTTPS (required for Twilio)

5. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

## How It Works

1. **Call Initiation**:
   - Customer calls Twilio number
   - Twilio establishes WebSocket connection with server

2. **Real-time Processing**:
   - Speech-to-Text: Customer audio → Deepgram → Text
   - Processing: Text → OpenAI GPT → Response
   - Text-to-Speech: Response → Deepgram → Audio
   - Audio streamed back to caller

3. **Key Features**:
   - Real-time transcription and response
   - Natural conversation handling
   - Interruption detection
   - Ordered message queuing

## Future Improvements

- Implement streaming TTS API from Deepgram for reduced latency
- Integrate Elevenlabs for enhanced voice quality
- Add outbound calling capabilities
- Implement function calling for complex tasks
- Add more sophisticated conversation handling

## Costs & Performance

- **Cost**: Approximately 1 cent per minute
  - Significantly lower than commercial alternatives ($5-10 cents/min)
- **Latency**: ~1 second response time
  - Can be further optimized with streaming TTS
